    **A record-high 11,462 students applied** to Pomona's class of 2025, a marked increase over the usual 10,000-10,500 applications in previous years. 10,388 applied to the class of 2024, and 10,401 to the class of 2023.
  [/Step]

  [Step]
    // graph of acceptance rate over time
    The increased number of applications, and the admission of only 745 students compared to 895 students the year before, made for **a record low acceptance rate of 6.5%.** The acceptance rate was 8.6% the year before.
  [/Step]

  [Step]
    Why the lower number of admits? Chiefly because **83 students admitted to the class of 2024 deferred their enrollment to Fall 2020,** the most in Pomona's history.
  [/Step]

  [Step]
    Of the 828 newly admitted and deferred enrollment students, 469 enrolled and became members of the class of 2025. The class of 2024 has 460 students and the class of 2023 455. **All three classes currently have more students than [any class has had in the last ten years.](https://www.pomona.edu/administration/registrar/reports-statistics/student-body)**

    //    {"Semester": "Fall '21", "First-year": 469, "Sophomore": 460, "Junior": 455, "Senior": 363},

    // ]` /]

  [Step]
    The class of 2024 is one of Pomona's most diverse. **The class of 2025 is slightly less so.**

    // replace with custom table component with colors
    [Table data:`[
        {"Race/Ethnicity": "Asian American", 2025: "ðŸ”» 15.5%", 2024: "19.8%"},
        {"Race/Ethnicity": "Black/African American", 2025: "ðŸ”» 7%", 2024: "10.8%"},
        {"Race/Ethnicity": "Latinx", 2025: "ðŸ”» 15.5%", 2024: "16.5%"},
        {"Race/Ethnicity": "International", 2025: "ðŸ”¼ 15%", 2024: "10.5%"},
        {"Race/Ethnicity": "Multiracial", 2025: "ðŸ”» 0.5%", 2024: "7.3%"},
        {"Race/Ethnicity": "White", 2025: "ðŸ”¼ 32.5%", 2024: "30.6%"},
    ]` columns:`[{header: "Race/Ethnicity"}, {header: 2025}, {header: 2024}]` /]
  [/Step]

  [Step]
    Notably, **only 13% of the class of 2025 are first-gen students,** compared to 28% of the class of 2024.
  [/Step]

  [Step]
    This is in spite of programs like QuestBridge Match and the Posse Foundation running as normal.
